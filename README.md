## Background
Build a webpage using Plotly.js, a Javascript visualization library to plot data from external files and/or web-sources into a bar, pie and bubble charts. Utilized Javascript functional programming and methods to create interactive features, such as buttons or drop down menus, build chart components and finally HTML/Bootstrap script tags to stylize and arrange the data to publish the results.

## Overview
Many bacteria species are not well studied and many more are unknown. We are tasked to assist a Rosa, a biomedical researcher who is responsible to study and document these bacterias. She is particularly interested in bacteria that synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Alternative meat companies have been successful in synthesizing this flavor profile using bacteria found in algae, and a few other organic matters. Improbable Foods is interested in finding the "perfect" flavor. Rosa believes that there might be a microorganism that can achieve the results that they are looking for. She theorizes that the ideal bacteria may be found in the human body, specifically the "belly button". In order to consolidate the data that has been collected, Rosa would like us to create a dashboard that can be accessed from anywhere. This webpage will be the main source for research team, as well as, the anonymous participants that are interested in knowing about the bacterias that have colonized in their belly buttons.
